Notice abstract
===========

Un abstract en anglais reprenant les points importants du rapport de stage est
demandé par l'EPITA

## Plan

* Presentation of the company where the internship was carried out (activities,
  short history, number of employees, turnover etc.).

* Presentation of the general function of the service in which you worked and
  of the team with whom you worked (supposing there is a team). A brief
  introduction of the internship supervisor would be helpful.

* Description of the work you were asked to carry out as defined at the
  beginning of the internship. State the skills that were considered necessary
  to fulfil the expectations of the internship supervisor.

* Description of the existing state of affairs (hardware, software, timeline of
  the existing project if you joined a project team that had already begun
  working).

* Timeline of the project and/or breakdown of the work done during the
  internship in units of one week (a chart is necessary here).

* General appreciation of the work you did. Be explicit about the working
  conditions and the relationship built up between the team members and/or
  client (if your internship involved a commercial relationship).

* Detail in a list form the engineering skills that you acquired during the
  internship.

* As a conclusion, give a critical overview of the value of the experience
  noting the highlights
  but also the negative points (supposing that there were negative points).
